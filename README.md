This is a React-based portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences. It is built using the modern development stack with Vite for fast builds and optimizations. The website is deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access.

## Features

This portfolio was built with the help of the following tutorial: [How to Become a Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpIel9cv4Jk&t=7281s). This tutorial helped me get started with React and Vite, two technologies that Iâ€™m now confident in using.
