# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules to maintain code quality.

Available Plugins
Currently, two official plugins are available for integrating React with Vite:

@vitejs/plugin-react
This plugin uses Babel to enable Fast Refresh, ensuring that the development experience is smooth and state is preserved while updating components during development.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
This plugin uses SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) for Fast Refresh. SWC is a faster alternative to Babel, offering improved performance during the build and development process.
